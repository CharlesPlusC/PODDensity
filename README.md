## Overview

This repository provides tools for processing precise ephemeris data to retrieve thermospheric densities during geomagnetic storms. The main functionalities include:

- **Data Acquisition:** Scripts to retrieve SP3 orbit files from the GFZ Potsdam FTP server (`Get_SP3_from_GFZ_FTP.py`), merge them into continuous ephemerides, convert them to the inertial frame (J2000/EME2000)
- **Density Inversion:** Scripts to perform density inversion (`source/DensityInversion/PODDensity.py`).
- **Branches:** 
  - The `main` branch contains the complete codebase, including estimated densities for CHAMP, TerraSAR-X, and GRACE-FO-A, as well as scripts to reproduce the paper's results.
  - The `lite` branch is identical but excludes the `SWindices` folder (~2 GB of space weather index data), which is used for plotting indices in the paper.
- **Batch Processing:** The `Storm Time Density` script allows for simultaneous density inversion across multiple storms listed in `misc/selected_storms.txt` on a compute cluster.
- **Space Weather Indices:** `SWIndices.py` contains code to identify and categorize all geomagnetic storms during the operational lifetime of each satellite studied.
- **Computation Libraries:** The Orekit Python Wrapper is used extensively for force modeling, frame transformations, and density model computations.

## Reproducing the Paper's Results

To replicate the figures presented in the paper, run the following commands from the root directory:

```bash
python -m source.DensityInversion.GFOAccelerometryBenchmark
python -m source.DensityInversion.Plotting.PODDensityPlotting
```

## Outputs:
The following repo will enable you to replicate all figures in the paper (and a number of others that were not included for brevity). As a quick illustration of the capabilities contained some example are included below.
