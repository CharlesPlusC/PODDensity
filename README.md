## Introduction

This repository provides a suite of tools for the processing and analysis of precise ephemeris data to derive thermospheric densities during geomagnetic storms.

## Key Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Automated scripts to fetch SP3 orbit files from the GFZ Potsdam FTP server, convert them into continuous ephemerides, and transform the data to the inertial frame (J2000/EME2000). See `Get_SP3_from_GFZ_FTP.py` for implementation details.
- **Density Inversion**: Core routines to perform density inversion from satellite ephemerides, as detailed in `source/DensityInversion/PODDensity.py` and `source/DensityInversion/EDRDensity.py`.
- **Batch Processing**: The `StormTimeDensity.py` script enables batch processing of multiple geomagnetic storms, facilitating density inversion on compute clusters.
- **Space Weather Indices**: Scripts for identifying and categorizing geomagnetic storms based on space weather indices are available in `SWIndices.py`, which includes methods to process data for the entire operational lifetime of each satellite.

## Reproducing the Paper's Results

To replicate the figures and results presented in the paper, execute the following commands from the root directory:

```bash
python -m source.DensityInversion.Plotting.{}.py
```

where `{}` is the name of the script to run. For example, to generate the density inversion plots comparing all methods on the same storm, run:

```bash
python -m source.DensityInversion.Plotting.AllMethods1Storm.py
```

## Outputs

This repository allows the reproduction of all figures included in the paper, along with additional plots that provide further insights. Examples of the generated outputs are illustrated below:
