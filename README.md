<h3 align="center">POD Density Inversion</h3>

<p align="center">
    This repo contains code accompanying the paper "Real-Time Thermospheric Density Retrieval from Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Ephemerides During Geomagnetic Storms" by Charles Constant, Santosh Bhattarai, Indigo Brownhall, Anasuya Aruliah and Marek Zeibart (2024).

- The repo contains tools to pull SP3 orboits from GFZ potsdam FTP (`Get_SP3_from_GFZ_FTP.py`), merge the files into continuous ephemerides and convert them to an interial-frame (J2000/EME2000) and perform density inversion on these (`source/DensityInversion/PODDensity.py`).
- The underlying library used for many of the computations (force modelling/frame transformations/ density model calls) is the Orekit Python Wrapper, which is a Python wrapper for the Orekit Java library.
- The repo comes in 2 branches. The main branch contains the code, the estimated densities for CHAMP, TerraSAR-X and GRACE-A (in output/DensityInversion/PODDensityInversion/Data/StormAnalysis)and the code to reproduce the results in the paper. The `lite' branch is identical but does not contain the SWindices folder (~2Gb of data) which are used to plots containing space weather indices in the paper.
- Storm Time Density provides a script to perform the denstiy inversion on a compute cluster for all storm specified in `misc/selected_storms.txt' simultaneously.
- SWIndices.py contains code to idenify and categorize all storms during the lifetime of each satellite studied.

- The figures in the paper can be replicated by running the following from root:
```zsh
python -m source.DensityInversion.GFOAccelerometryBenchmark
python -m source.DensityInversion.Plotting.PODDensityPlotting
```
